# WorkoutTracker

Fitness Tracker allows a user to view and create daily workouts. A user can log multiple exercise workouts on a given day.  They can list the type, weight, and reps of an excercise. 

I am using mongoDB and Mongoose ODM on this repo.  This has been deployed to heroku. Here is the link to the deployed app:
